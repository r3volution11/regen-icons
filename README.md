# Regen - Icons for macOS Apps

This is a spot for me to share icons I've created to use on my local setup. I prefer circles for my icons. In some cases I used icons by other great designers but I also have a few of my own ideas. In one case, Iconjar, I liked the original icon better so I brought it back. Those are here.

## How To Change Icons

For the most part replacing an app's icon is as simple as copying an image and pasting in that app's info panel. Here's a more detailed guide by 9to5Mac on how to do it: [How to change Mac app icons](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/17/change-mac-icons/)

FreeMacSoft also makes a great app for changing system icons as well as apps: [LiteIcon](https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/)

### Textual

Textual requires changing two icon files. They're provided in the `icns/textual` directory. Replace these:

1. /Applications/Textual.app/Contents/Resources/applicationIcon.icns
2. /Applications/Textual.app/Contents/Resources/applicationIconBirthday.icns
