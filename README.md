# Regen - Circle Icons for macOS Apps

This is a spot for me to share icons I've (re)created to use on my local setup. I prefer consistency for my icons and like circles the most on desktop. I'm not trying to recreate the wheel, just making sure they're all round.

## How To Change Icons

For the most part replacing an app's icon is as simple as copying an image and pasting in that app's info panel. Here's a more detailed guide by 9to5Mac on how to do it: [How to change Mac app icons](https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/17/change-mac-icons/)

FreeMacSoft also makes a great app for changing system icons as well as apps: [LiteIcon](https://freemacsoft.net/liteicon/)

### Textual

Textual requires changing two icon files. They're provided in the `icns/textual` directory. Replace these:

1. `/Applications/Textual.app/Contents/Resources/applicationIcon.icns`
2. `/Applications/Textual.app/Contents/Resources/applicationIconBirthday.icns`
